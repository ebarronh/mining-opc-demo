# MineSensors OPC UA Mining Demo – Phase 5: Enterprise Integration Hub PRD

## Introduction/Overview

Phase 5 transforms the MineSensors OPC UA Mining Demo into a comprehensive **Enterprise Integration Hub** that showcases real-world mining technology integrations. Building on the 3D visualization and OPC UA explorer from Phase 4, this phase demonstrates how modern mining operations integrate sensor data from shovels and conveyors with enterprise systems, fleet management, and cloud analytics platforms.

**Problem Statement**: Mining operations struggle to understand how real-time sensor data flows from equipment to enterprise systems. New MineSensors employees and customers need to understand the complete integration architecture, from XRF sensors on shovels to ERP systems and cloud analytics.

**Goal**: Create an interactive integration showcase that demonstrates MineSensors' OEM-agnostic approach, Oracle cloud integration, Delta Share protocol implementation, and the business value of real-time ore grade analysis.
