## Data Flows and Integration Points

### Vertical Integration
Information flows up and down the hierarchy levels:

**Upward Flow (Level 0 → Level 4):**
- Real-time production data

- Resource allocation decisions
- Safety and environmental policies

### Horizontal Integration
Information exchange within the same level:
- Equipment coordination at Level 2
- Cross-functional data sharing at Level 3 (production, maintenance, quality)
- Business system integration at Level 4 (ERP, CRM, SCM)

### Four Primary Information Types

1. **Material Information**
   - Ore grades and geological data
   - Production volumes and throughput
   - Inventory levels (ore stockpiles, consumables)
   - Quality test results and specifications

2. **Equipment Information**
   - Equipment status and performance
   - Maintenance schedules and history
   - Capacity and utilization rates
   - Energy consumption data

3. **Physical Asset Information**
   - Mine infrastructure status
   - Facility conditions and compliance
   - Environmental monitoring data
   - Safety systems status

4. **Personnel Information**
   - Workforce scheduling and allocation
   - Skills and certifications
